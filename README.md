# [GOOGLE PLAYSTORE EDA](-link-)

This is a project I did for my masters research paper, where I build a recommendation system for a movies dataset.

*	Utilized Python to analyze google play store application categories and gain insights on which categories need to be considered while developing an application
*	Performed data wrangling by using pandas, numpy and regex techniques
*	Visualized the data by using matplotlib and seaborn to compile a professional report
*	Created an interactive dashboard with Tableau to visualize the important KPIs of the analysis
