# [GOOGLE PLAYSTORE EDA](-link-)

This is a project where I analyzed a Google Play Store dataset and provided solutions to the business using Exploratory Data Analysis approach

*	Utilized Python to analyze google play store application categories and gain insights on which categories need to be considered while developing an application
*	Performed data wrangling by using pandas, numpy and regex techniques
*	Visualized the data by using matplotlib and seaborn to compile a professional report
*	Created an interactive dashboard with Tableau to visualize the important KPIs of the analysis. [Dashboard Link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bharathkumar.tamilarasu/viz/GooglePlayStoreAnalysis_16966154021780/PlayStoreAnalysis)
